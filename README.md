## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Programming language used for Android development
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native UI
- **ViewModel**: Manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way
- **LiveData**: Data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes
- **Retrofit**: Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
- **Glide**: Image loading and caching library
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous programming


## Usage

- Open the app and allow location permissions if prompted.
- The app will display the current weather for your location.
- Use the search bar to find weather information for other locations.
- Swipe down to refresh the weather data.
